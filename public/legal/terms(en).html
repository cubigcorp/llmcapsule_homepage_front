<p>Service usage fees shall be charged in advance unless otherwise agreed. If the service content is changed during the service period, fees shall be prorated based on the remaining days.</p>
<p>If the service fee structure changes during the user's service period, the original fee structure will apply for the remaining service period.</p>

<p>When billing criteria change, the original contract terms apply to the remaining period at the time of implementation.</p>

<p>If there is an individual agreement, that agreement takes precedence.</p>

<h2>21. Payment of Service Fees, etc.</h2>
<p>Payment Methods: Bank transfer, electronic payment processing (credit card, automatic transfer, etc.). Additional usage may be restricted if the limit is exceeded according to the payment institution's policy.</p>
<p>Matters related to individual electronic payment agency services follow the policies of the financial company operating that service.</p>
<p>Automatic payments or transfers will proceed periodically until canceled.</p>
<p>Users must exercise due care to prevent unauthorized use of their payment methods and prevent disclosure of authentication methods.</p>
<p>Service use may be restricted in case of payment failure or non-payment, and the user bears responsibility for any resulting damages.</p>
<p>The Company may add, delete, or change payment methods and will provide prior notice.</p>

<h2>22. Fee Dispute Claims</h2>
<p>Claims may be filed within 6 months from the billing date (no time limit for overpayments due to the Company's fault).</p>
<p>The Company will notify the result within 2 weeks of receipt; if not possible, it will provide the reason and processing deadline.</p>

<h2>23. Claim for Illegally Evaded Fees</h2>
<p>If the user fails to pay service fees using any of the following methods, the user shall pay the Company a penalty equal to twice the amount of the unpaid fees.</p>
<p>a. Evading fees by using services other than those applied for without the Company's approval</p>
<p>b. Allowing a third party to use this service without the Company's approval</p>
<p>c. Evading fees by violating other relevant laws and regulations or these Terms and Conditions</p>

<h2>24. Refund of Fees</h2>
<p>If a user overpays or mistakenly pays service fees, the Company shall immediately refund the amount to the user. If the Company is at fault for the overpayment or mistaken payment, the Company shall refund the overpaid amount plus interest at the statutory rate to the user.</p>
<p>If a User requests termination of the service during its use, service usage will automatically end before the start of the following month's service, and no refund will be provided for the remaining service period.</p>
<p>If a User withdraws their application for service use within 7 days of the service start date without any usage history, the Company shall refund the User the amount minus the following fees:</p>
<p>a. Transfer fees, PG fees</p>
<p>b. Promotion discount amounts</p>
<p>A deduction of 10% of the remaining amount, including transfer fees and PG fees, will be applied during refunds.</p>
<p>Service fee refunds will be processed by the end of the month following the refund request date. However, if the user has any outstanding debts to the company, the company may offset the amount equivalent to such debts from the refundable amount or withhold the refund.</p>
<p>Credit card cancellations follow the card issuer's policy, and the Company bears no refund responsibility beyond cancellation requests (except where the Company is at fault).</p>

<h2>25. Termination of Contract</h2>
<p>The User may request termination via the Service, email, etc.</p>
<p>The Company may terminate the User Agreement regardless of the User's intent if the User falls under any of the following items:</p>
<p>a. The User violates a material term of these Terms and the Company requests correction, but the User fails to correct it within the specified period.</p>
<p>b. The User uses the Service for purposes other than those intended by the Service Use Agreement or unlawfully lends the right to use the Service to a third party.</p>
<p>c. The User's use is suspended due to a violation of these Terms, and subsequent use is suspended again for the same reason.</p>
<p>d. If the user fails to pay fees on two or more occasions🡪 Unilaterally terminating the contract solely for non-payment is unfair. Furthermore, since Article 19 of these Terms already states that service may be suspended for non-payment, the authority to take both actions immediately is excessive.</p>
<p>e. When it is objectively evident that the user cannot fulfill the service contract due to reasons such as bankruptcy, rehabilitation application, business revocation, or license revocation (for corporations).</p>
<p>If the contract is terminated or canceled before installation is complete, the user shall pay the installation costs based on the work completed (except in cases attributable to the company).</p>
<p>The party responsible for the termination or cancellation forfeits the benefit of time.</p>

<h2>26. Protection of Services, etc.</h2>
<p>The User shall not reproduce or leak LLM Capsule without authorization.</p>
<p>The User shall not produce or sell (including circumvention) LLM Capsule or similar solutions without authorization, either during or after the termination of the contract.</p>
<p>Violation shall result in bearing all civil and criminal legal liabilities.</p>

<h2>27. Data Preservation and Destruction</h2>
<p>Users bear an ongoing obligation to back up data. The Company shall not be liable for any leakage, omission, or loss resulting from failure to comply (except where a separate backup agreement exists or the Company is at fault).</p>
<p>Payment information and similar data may be stored separately for the period required by law.</p>

<h2>28. Copyright of Posted Conten</h2>
<p>Intellectual property rights pertaining to the Service itself belong to the Company.</p>
<p>Intellectual property rights for data posted or registered by the User belong to the User.</p>
<p>Commercial use, such as processing or selling information obtained through the Service, is prohibited.</p>

<h2>29. Scope of Damages and Claims</h2>

<p>If the same disruption occurs within one hour after normalization, it shall be considered a continuous disruption.</p>
